## Paper Swordsmen in the Web
---

With enterprises across movies, fiction, video game, and licensed merchandise, fictional “universes” such as the Marvel Universe are important market forces of our economy as well as an immerse system of narrative elements and signification.

The *Transmedia Fictional Worlds Ontology* (TFWO) developed by the GAMER Research Group at the University of Washington is an ontology that attempted to model two things.

1. Economically, it models the complex relation among creative works (individual stories, meta-storylines, adaptations) and agents (creators, contributors, copyright owners, and fans) of the transmedia fictional world system.

2. Culturally, it models the system of narrative elements and signification which drive the storylines.

Developed with materials from western creative works, namely Harry Potter, the Marvel Universe, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, TFWO is questionably geographically limited. *Paper Swordsmen in the Web* took the case of Jin Yong’s Wuxia Universe, a martial art fictional world created by the greatest Hong Kong novelist ever since the 1950s, to test the general applicability of TFWO.
