## Lyrics Space Odyssey
<sup>with Fengan Li, Hugo Enrique Montaño Castillo, Lars Magne Tungland, Martina Verna and Xin Wang</sup>

*Lyrics Space Odyssey* is a data storytelling project exploring the Million Song Dataset. It is composed of a series of visualizations, which all contribute to displaying different – but complementary - aspects of the same data. The project's objective is to provide a platform for audiences to explore the relationship between word choice of a lyric, song genre and popularity. In the end, audiences are given full autonomy to utilize the interactive exploratory tool for composing their own.

The Million Song Dataset is a freely available collection of audio features and metadata consisting of one million contemporary popular music tracks. As the Million Song Dataset core does not include metadata for genre and lyric, data fusion is completed with Tableau Prep to augment the target data from the MusixMatch Dataset and TagTraum Dataset.

The final narrative is divided into three conceptual chapters: **Describe**, **Explore**, **Create**.

## 1. Describe

### Lyrics and Word Co-occurrence Networks

A Gephi networks that present an introductory overview, showing a galaxy of edges and nodes: the audience here detects color clusters and perceives the complexity of the data, so that they wants to know more about them.

In the lyrics network, each nodes represent a song and an edge is encoded to represent two songs that have over 30% of vocabularies overlapped in their lyrics. The lyrics network is constructed in the light of genres, which shows interesting insight: rap (orange) stands out with a unique vocabulary field.

AWS and a Gephi instance are used to compute a network graph of million songs.
```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
