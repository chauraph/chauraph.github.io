## Lyrics Space Odyssey

*Lyrics Space Odyssey* is a data storytelling project exploring the Million Song Dataset. It is composed of a series of visualizations, which all contribute to displaying different â€“ but complementary - aspects of the same data. The project's objective is to provide a platform for audiences to explore the relationship between word choice of a lyric, song genre and popularity. In the end, audiences are given full autonomy to utilize the interactive exploratory tool for composing their own.

The Million Song Dataset is a freely available collection of audio features and metadata consisting of one million contemporary popular music tracks. In *Odyssey*, we intended to focus on word frequency, song popularity metrics and genre. As the Million Song Dataset core does not include genre and lyric, data fusion is completed with Tableau Prep to augment the target data from the MusixMatch Dataset and TagTraum Dataset.

The final narrative is divided into three conceptual chapters: **Describe**, **Explore**, **Create**.

### 1. Describe

Songs share over 30% of identical words in their lyrics are linked, while the rest gets excluded from the network. The lyrics network is constructed in the light of genres, which shows interesting insight: rap stands out with a unique vocabulary field.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
